# BingoBoard

This is a basic implementation of a Bingo board tracker, intended to be used with Bingo cards.

The text-based version does not require any dependencies besides a recent version of Python3. The web-based version requires nicegui (Python-based web framework because I didn't want to use JavaScript today) as well.

## Usage
- Clone the repo
- To play the text-based terminal game: `python3 BingoBackend/BingoGame.py`
- To play the web-based game
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - `python3 BingoWeb.py`
    - if browser does not automatically open, navigate to the IP/port shown after running

## Requirements
- python3.8+
- nicegui
